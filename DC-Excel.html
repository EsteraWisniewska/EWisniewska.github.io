										<h1>Data Cleaning & Preparation - Excel</h1>
									</header>
									<p><strong>INTRODUCTION.</strong></p>
									<p>Excel file used in this project contains information about online store employees.
										It contains First and Last name, department, email, home address, starting date and salary.

										<p>The task is to clear data set to be more useful and standardized. We do not need to remove any irrelevant columns and can proceed with next step, removing duplicate data.

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Deduplication</h2>
									<p>Duplicated data usually was created by error and in most cases should not be there. They are unnecessary waste of space and time, moreover they are increasing chances for potential problems and costly mistakes.</p>
									
									<span class="image"><img src="images/Removing duplicates.png" alt="" style="width: 800px;;height: 400px;"/></span>
									<p></p>I am going to analyse and remove rows which contains exact copy of employees information.</p>
									<span class="image"><img src="images/removing dup 2.png" alt="" style="width: 800px;;height: 400px;"/></span>

									<h2>Fixing structural errors</h2>
									<p><strong>FORMATTING AND STANDARDIZATION – </strong>all cells within column will be displayed the same way.
										<p></p>Depending on requested format, words can be formatted to upper or lower cases. Otherwise standard format will be applied using formula PROPER()
										<p>
											I am formatting 'First' and 'Last Name' columns to standardize appearance of data. Each cell in both columns will start from capitol letter.</p>
											<p></p><span class="image"><img src="images/Name Formating.png" alt="" style="width: 300px;;height: 300px;"/></span>
											<p>
												<p><strong>REMOVING SPACING - </strong>removing unnecessary spaces, before and/or after the word. 
												<p></p>While spacing before word its clearly visible, spotting spacing at the end of the word is not that simple. It may appear that as long as data looks ‘right’, additional spaces after the word should not matter.
												In general that may be okay if you are going to use, and keep data in excel. But if you want to use data in SQL or Python (especially numeric), additional spaces may cause issues. 
												Therefore TRIMING is necessary.
										<p></p><span class="image"><img src="images/trim before.png" alt="" style="width: 200px;;height: 400px;"/></span>
												</p>
										<strong>DATE FORMATING</strong>

									<p></p>Firstly I have changed date format to ‘Short date’. This removed name of the day and month and turn it into numbers, moreover have changed year into 4 digits instead of 2.
									Some date was written with ‘/ ’ as separator, others with ‘.’ I replaced all dot-separators with slash.
									<p></p><span class="image"><img src="images/date.png" alt="" style="width: 400px;;height: 400px;"/></span>
									
											<p></p><strong>CURRENCY - </strong>Adjusting currency in salary table. 

											<p></p>If data will be used in any programming language it is advisory to remove currency sign as program may read cells as a strings not integers/ floats. This will require later on  further conversion if we would like to perform any calculations using those fields.
											
											<p></p>For easier usage in programs I removed .00 at the end of the salary.
											<p></p><span class="image"><img src="images/salary.png" alt="" style="width: 200px;;height: 200px;"/></span>
									
											
									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Filtering data out</h2>
									<p></p>Using <strong>FILTER</strong> option to check values entered into column. 
									<p></p>I am looking for any unusual 'values' in each column. It may be misspelled word, very high or very low numeric value or starting date placed in the future.
									<p></p>
									<p></p><span class="image"><img src="images/department filter.png" alt="" style="width: 500px;;height: 500px;"/></span>
									<p></p>Founded misspelled ‘Marketing’ and corrected it. This correction is needed in case we would like to present specific calculations based on department divisions. 
									If I would not correct it, program would understood it as another department.
									<p></p>Similar to the 'Whig' department which was duplicated with additional/unwanted characters after
									Filtering them and removing words and signs after department’s name allowing to bring two fields together as its originally meant to be.

									<h2>Dealing with missing data</h2>
									
									<p></p>After scanning data I did not find any missing data which were very important and urgently needed.
